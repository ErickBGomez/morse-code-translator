**Morse Code Translator** is a simple Windows Form project. The user can convert any plain text into Morse code and vice versa.

This project has been done using Windows Form (.NET Framework 4.8) to build a desktop application for the Windows operating system. In addition to using the C# programming language for the functionality and logic of the application.

The purpose of this project, in addition to helping the user understand how morse code works, is to demonstrate my programming skills using C# as well as further expand my knowledge in the development, design and deployment of desktop applications.
